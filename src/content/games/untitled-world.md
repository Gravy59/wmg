This is an upcoming project: an open-world game that combines air, land, and sea
mechanics with dynamic multiplayer systems. Our goal is to create a game that
delivers depth, freedom, and a highly immersive experience.

## The World

This game will feature a procedural map that loads chunks on demand. The systems
are designed to let you approach challenges in your own way. There will be three
main areas to the game:

- Land: Explore, build, trade. Players will visit cities, wander the rural
  landscape, and enter into firefights with other teammates.
- Sea: Small boats to aircraft carriers. You _can_ fish, but it's more fun to
  shoot missiles and torpedoes at people.
- Air: This will be a highly airship-focused game. Similar to sea, except you
  can launch fighter jets from your airships and fight battles in 3D.

## Game Modes

We might have them, we might not. I'm favoring the option for both singleplayer
and multiplayer. Multiplayer servers should support 20-50 players.

## Expected Early Access Date

Don't hold your breath.
