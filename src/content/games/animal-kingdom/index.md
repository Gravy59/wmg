Animal Kingdom was a town building game where players could communities across
multiple islands. The design drew inspiration from Animal Crossing. I crafted
every part of the game independently in Godot and learned a lot from this
project, but unfortunately I had to also spend time getting educated and this
project has been abandoned.

I developed a custom water shader with light refraction for the ocean.
Inhabiting the ocean were several islands that followed a tiling grid system for
placement of buildings et al. When building things on the island, I created a
wireframe system which took more time than I thought.

_The grid system was the backbone of the whole game._
