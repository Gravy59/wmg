Animal Kingdom was a town building title where players could communities across multiple islands.
The design drew inspiration from Animal Crossing. Weible crafted every part of the game
independently in Godot. He learned a lot from this project, but unfortunately he had to also spend
time getting educated and this project has been abandoned.

The custom water shader delivers gentle motion in seas and rivers, reflecting the calm atmosphere of
island life. A grid system was built for smooth placement of buildings and decorations, creating a
straightforward method to construct and arrange settlements. Progression across islands reveals
fresh tiles, creatures, and building themes, encouraging creativity at each step. The art style
features stylized characters, terrain, and props made with wireframes to maintain a clear,
consistent look. Those outlines provide a distinctive style and emphasize the handcrafted nature of
every model.

Weible developed a custom water shader with light refraction for the ocean. Inhabiting the ocean
were several islands that followed a tiling grid system for placement of buildings et al. When
building, the island featured an optimized wireframe system.
